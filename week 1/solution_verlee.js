Description: A program that demonstrates the use of JavaScript types, values, 
and variables in an application.
*/

// Start program.

//Expected output:

/*
First name
Last name 
Age 
Street 
City 
State 
Zip code
*/

// The variable declaration and assignment.
var firstName = "Verlee";
var lastName = "Washington";
var age = "\n37";
var street  "\n1800 Learning St.";
var city = "\nHome town";
var state = "Bellevue";
var zipCode = "89647";

// The last line of code to write, the output.
console.log (firstName, "" + lastName
+ age + street + city, "" + 
state, "" + zipCode;

// End program.


//*Solution*

 // Declared variables
        
        var firstName = "Verlee";
        var lastName = "Washington"
        var age = 37
        var street = "1800 Learning St."
        var city = "Hometown"
        var state = "Bellevue" 
        var zipcode = 89647

// Output
        
        document.write(firstName + "<br>", lastName + "<br>", age + "<br>", street + "<br>", city + "<br>", state + "<br>", zipcode);
  
  
  //*Detailed Explanation*
  
  /*The author created a string for each variable.
  The first correction I made was to remove the quotes from the age and zipcode, these values are numbers, not text.
  Next I removed \n from the age, street and city variables because I didnt think they were needed and to clean up the code.
  I believe the author inserted \n to create a new line but I decided to tackle that in my output.
  The author detailed to write the code so I changed the output to document.write instead of console.log, which would instead log the output in the console.
  Lastly, I entered breaks in between each variable so the output would write each variable on a seperate line per the author's expected output.*/
